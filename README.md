## Description of the Code

This project performs data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for predicting stock market values and classifying stock performance using the Nifty 500 dataset. It employs various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

1. **Loading Data**: The code begins by loading the Nifty 500 dataset from a CSV file using pandas.
  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Several columns containing numeric values represented as strings with a '-' are converted to missing values (NaN). The specified columns are then converted to numeric types, coercing any errors that arise from the conversion.

3. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - The `Change` column is filled by calculating the difference between `Last Traded Price` and `Previous Close`.
   - Missing values in `365 Day Percentage Change` and `30 Day Percentage Change` are filled with their respective column means.

4. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: Unneeded columns such as company name and symbol are dropped from the dataset, leaving only relevant features for modeling.

### Feature Scaling and Splitting

5. **Feature Scaling**: The `MinMaxScaler` is applied to normalize the feature values to a range between 0 and 1. This is important for algorithms sensitive to the scale of the data.

6. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 20% of the data allocated for testing to evaluate model performance.

### Model Training and Evaluation

7. **Linear Regression**:
   - A Linear Regression model is initialized and trained on the training set.
   - Predictions are made on the test set, and performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated.

8. **Random Forest Regressor**:
   - A Random Forest Regressor is also initialized and trained on the same training set.
   - Predictions are made, and similar performance metrics (MAE and RMSE) are calculated.

### Visualization of Results

9. **Scatter Plots**: Scatter plots are created to visually compare the predicted values against the actual values for both Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

10. **Comparison of Models**: A summary of model performance is printed, highlighting which model performs better based on MAE and RMSE metrics.

### Classification Task

11. **Further Data Processing**: The code further processes the dataset to convert percentage change columns into binary classification targets (1 for positive change, 0 for non-positive).

12. **Robust Scaling**: A `RobustScaler` is applied to selected numerical columns to reduce the influence of outliers in the dataset.

13. **Model Training for Classification**:
   - Various classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) are initialized for predicting the binary target variable.
   - Cross-validation is performed for each model to assess performance, with scores for accuracy and recall being calculated.

### Visualization of Classification Results

14. **Performance Comparison**: Box plots and bar plots are created to visualize the cross-validated accuracy scores of the different classification models.

### Conclusion

The code systematically loads, preprocesses, and analyzes the Nifty 500 dataset, utilizing both regression and classification techniques to predict stock prices and assess stock performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, applies various models, and compares their effectiveness through multiple metrics and visualizations.
